# AssemblyGraphVisualization
AssemblyGraphVisualization is a program to visualize all possible paths an assembly can be build. <br>
Generate the assembly graph with [Assembly Graph Visualization - Assemble them all](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/st161399/AssemblyGraphVisualization-AssembleThemAll)

# Adding Instructions 
To add instructions first choose which parts should be assembled and which should be disassembled by clicking the checkboxes next to each part name in the parts list.<br>
A part that is currently assembled and whose chakbox is checked is one which will have to be assembled for the instructions to be shown.<br>
The same is true for a part that is disassembled and whose checkbox is checked.<br>
Now click on the Edit button (the middle one in the upper left box). Now you can add any html code to the textArea.<br>
To save the instructions simply click the edit button again and the html will be rendered and the instructions saved.<br>
<br>
By middle clicking any part a part description can be added in the bottom right corner.

# Adding extra parts
To add extra Parts, click the add extra part button in the bottom right corner, then choose an OBJ file.<br>
Now the part will appear in the scene.<br>
If you shift click any part it will toggle transform handles that can be used to position the part in the scene.<br>
If the part is clicked it will be selected or unselected. All selected parts are outlined green and only selected parts will be saved.<br>
You can add a dotted line through one axis of the part by middle clicking it and selecting the axis on the menu in the bottom right.<br>
Once all parts are properly positioned in the scene you can save them by clicking the `save extra parts` button.
